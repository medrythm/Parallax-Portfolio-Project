        <h1>Project Inspiration</h1>
        <p>I am Mfumu Wealth Mabunda, residing in Soweto in Johannesburg. I have always been a passionate front-end development student dating back from 2019, eager to enhance my skills and leave a mark on the digital world. However, i often found my self yearning for inspiration and a project that would truly challenge my abilities.
            <br><br>One day, as i was scrolling through my social media feed, i stumbled upon a mesmerising video showcasing the stunning effects of a parallax scrolling effect on a website. intrigued by the visually captivating experience, i delved deeper into the world of parallax websites, reading articles and watching tutorials that explained the intricacies of this innovative web design technique.
            <br><br>With every new piece of information, my curiosity grew, and i knew that i had found the inspiration i had been searching for. Determined to master parallax web development, i set out to create my own project that would not only showcase my skills but also push the boundries of my creativity.
            <br><br>My idea began to take shape as i envisioned a website for a portfolio project for <b>Holberton School</b>. Driven by this newfound inspiration, i tirelessly worked on this project. During my SE programme at ALX i delved into the depths of HTML, CSS and Javascript, mastering the necessary coding techniques to bring my vision to life. Layer by layer, i carefully crafted the website, selecting captivating images and designing captivating animations that would seamlessly guide users through the adventure.
            <br><br>Days turned into nights as i poured my heart and soul into the project. I faced challenges along the way, encountering technical issues and refining my design to ensure a flawless user experience. However, my determination never wavered, and i eagerly embarked each obstacle as a opportunity for growth.
